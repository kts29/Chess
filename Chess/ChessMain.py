    # Good practice in Python:
    # - When run directly as a script, this block executes the programâ€™s main logic.
    # - When imported as a module, all global variables, functions, and classes are still

    #   but the main() function is not called automatically.
    # - This avoids unwanted side effects during imports, while still allowing reuse.
